Ever thought of combining the simplicity of a blackboard with the power of AI? That’s exactly what I’ve been working on! 🌟

🔍 About the Project:

This web application is an AI-enabled blackboard that lets you:

✅ Draw mathematical expressions directly on a virtual blackboard.

✅ Use AI to recognize and solve the expressions in real time.

✅ Customize your tools: pen, eraser, colors, and sizes for a seamless experience.

✅ Download your blackboard creations as images.

🌐 Tech Highlights:

Frontend: React.js for an interactive and responsive user interface.

Canvas Rendering: HTML5 Canvas for smooth, dynamic drawing.

Backend: Powered by Node.js, offering efficient, real-time communication with the AI backend.

AI Integration: Leveraging the Gemini API for advanced AI-driven expression recognition and calculations.

Deployment: Deployed on Vercel for scalability and fast performance.

User Experience: Mobile-friendly, dark-mode interface with responsive design. 

Node.js ensures seamless integration between the frontend and AI backend, enabling real-time processing of drawn inputs.

The Gemini API powers the recognition engine, transforming hand-drawn expressions into actionable results with incredible accuracy.

Together, they create a reliable, efficient, and innovative system to bridge the gap between users and complex problem-solving tools.


💡 Challenges Overcome:

Ensuring smooth drawing across devices (preventing browser-specific issues like "pull-to-refresh").

Creating an intuitive and minimalistic design for both mobile and desktop users.

Real-time AI processing for seamless interaction.
